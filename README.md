Morning-Coffee
==============

Branch of http://www.shaneliesegang.com/projects/coffee.php

Instructions-
Download morningCoffee@shaneliesegang.xpi and place the file in C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\%profile name%\extensions

History-
I used morning coffee quite a bit. The entire purpose is to load specific sites on specific days. But what happends if you miss a day? This happens to me quite a bit, so I decided to quickly modify the code.

Solution-
I've added a feauture to allow you to "Load Morning Coffee From" and choose the day you wish to load.
